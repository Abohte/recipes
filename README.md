# Recipes

Start of a simple React app made during week 5 of the 9-week Codaisseur Academy.

This app that contains a list of recipes was meant to get to know React (without Redux). The continuation if this app does include Redux: [Frontend](https://github.com/Abohte/recipes-react) and [Backend](https://github.com/Abohte/recipes-express).
